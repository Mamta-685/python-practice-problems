*********The 6-step method to write logic (use every time)************

Read & rephrase the problem in one sentence (in your own words).

Create 2–3 example inputs + outputs (include edge cases).

Brute force idea: say the simplest (even slow) solution in plain English.

Break it into sub-steps / helper functions. (List the functions and what each returns.)

Write pseudo-code (3–10 lines) — no language syntax, just steps.

Implement one sub-step, run tests, fix, continue. (Stop and test often.)


***********Debugging checklist (use it every time you get stuck)************

Re-run with the smallest example.

Dry-run on paper for that example (write variable values).

Add simple prints for critical variables (index, accumulators).

Use assert to check assumptions.

If logic is messy, revert to brute-force first — working brute force is easier to optimize.

Ask: “Which line changes the program state?” Trace that.
