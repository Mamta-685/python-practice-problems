*********The 6-step method to write logic (use every time)************

Read & rephrase the problem in one sentence (in your own words).

Create 2–3 example inputs + outputs (include edge cases).

Brute force idea: say the simplest (even slow) solution in plain English.

Break it into sub-steps / helper functions. (List the functions and what each returns.)

Write pseudo-code (3–10 lines) — no language syntax, just steps.

Implement one sub-step, run tests, fix, continue. (Stop and test often.)


***********Debugging checklist (use it every time you get stuck)************

Re-run with the smallest example.

Dry-run on paper for that example (write variable values).

Add simple prints for critical variables (index, accumulators).

Use assert to check assumptions.

If logic is messy, revert to brute-force first — working brute force is easier to optimize.

Ask: “Which line changes the program state?” Trace that.





**************🔹 Daily Workflow (Every new problem you solve)***********

Suppose today you solved palindrome.py.

Write/Save File

Save your file inside the repo folder (project root). Example: palindrome.py.

Commit Changes

Go to VCS → Commit… (or bottom-left Git tab).

Select the file (palindrome.py).

Write a message, e.g. Added palindrome problem solution.

Click Commit (or Commit and Push).

Push to GitHub

If you only committed: Go to VCS → Git → Push.

Confirm → Done ✅.

Now your file is uploaded to your GitHub repo.

🔹 Order of Work Each Day

Create file (like palindrome.py).

Save it inside repo folder.

Commit with a meaningful message.

Push to GitHub.
